# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis

### Overview

Social Media Sentiment Analysis is a real-time interactive dashboard built using Streamlit.
It allows you to analyze social media posts (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube) and understand public sentiment towards specific topics, products, or events.

The app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text data, extract sentiment scores, and visualize sentiment trends over time.
